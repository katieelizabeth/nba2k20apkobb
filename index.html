            <li><strong>Manage Your Cards:</strong> Think of your player cards like a collection. Keep the ones that help your team and sell the ones you don't need. This can earn you points to make your team even better. It's like trading cards with friends, but in the game!</li>
            <li><strong>Follow The Agenda:</strong> The game gives you goals to complete, called The Agenda. Stick to these goals to earn rewards like new players or points. It's like having a to-do list in the game, and checking off tasks feels awesome.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Your Money Wisely:</strong> In the game, you earn two types of money: MT and VC. MT is easier to get, so spend it on important things like new players. VC is harder to earn, so be careful with it. Save it for special occasions, like when you really need a boost.</li>

            <li><strong>Save Special Contracts:</strong> Some items in the game, like Diamond Contracts, are super valuable. Don't waste them on average players. Save them for your best players to make them even better. It's like giving your star players a special power-up.</li>
            <li><strong>Play Smart:</strong> Triple Threat Offline mode is a great way to earn points and improve your team. It's like a mini-game within the game, and you can win cool prizes by playing well. Keep at it, and you'll see your team grow stronger.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Rewards:</strong> Make it a habit to play every day. You'll get daily rewards just for showing up. It's like getting a gold star for being consistent. Plus, you'll never miss out on cool events or special bonuses.</li>
